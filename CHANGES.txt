OpenBlock 1.0a2
===============

Upgrade Notes
-------------

* If you have an existing database that was built with 1.0a1 or
  earlier, you'll need to run this command to deal with the removal
  of the "django-apikey" dependency: ``django-admin.py migrate apikey 0001 --fake``

* As usual, you should run after upgrading:
  ``django-admin.py syncdb --migrate``

  If you were unlucky and had last migrated with a git checkout
  including migrations that later got renamed or removed, you may get
  errors from migrating. In that case try adding the
  ``--delete-ghost-migrations`` option.

* Production webserver configurations will need a line added to get the
  django-olwidget javascript and CSS to show up.
  For example, for Apache you'd add a line like (adjust path as needed):
  ``Alias /olwidget/ /home/openblock/openblock/src/django-olwidget/``

* We now require Django 1.3. This probably doesn't have any impact on you.

* Settings changes:

  - MAP_BASELAYER_TYPE can now be any base layer supported by
    olwidget, eg. "google.streets".  (Some require other settings for
    eg. API keys; see ebpub/settings_default.py for comments and
    examples.)

  - You can add custom base layers to your maps by creating
    the dictionary settings.MAP_CUSTOM_BASE_LAYERS.
    See ebpub/settings_default.py for an example.

    This replaces the WMS_URL setting from openblock 1.0a1 which is no
    longer supported.


New Features
------------

 * Maps now support configurable icons or colors for each Schema.
   To use this, you can use the admin UI to configure "map icon url"
   or "map color" for a Schema.

 * REST API allows creating NewsItems via POST, with either API keys
   or HTTP Basic auth; see docs/main/api.rst

 * Configurable throttling of REST API.

 * Import US Zip Codes as Locations, via the admin UI.

 * Work-in-progress: user-submitted content. See code in the
   ebpub/neighbornews app.

 * Work-in-progress: Maps you can share just by copy/pasting a URL.
   For a sneak preview, browse to /maps/.

Bug fixes
---------

 * Importers should now not blow up if run more than once.
