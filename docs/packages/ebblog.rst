Customization
=============

The title, description, and link of the RSS feed should be set in
ebblog/blog/feeds.py. Also, most of the visual customization can be
accomplished by editing ebblog/templates/base.html. All of the other templates
inherit from base.html, so any styles added there will apply to the other
pages.
